require_dependency 'story_query'

# Implementation of the timeline shown on user homepages.
#
# Definitions:
#
# * For the purposes of the user timeline, an active user is defined as a user
#   who has generated a story in the last INACTIVE_DAYS days.
#
# Parameters:
# * INACTIVE_DAYS: Number of days before a user is considered to be inactive.
# * CACHE_SIZE: Number of stories shown in a user's timeline.
# * FRESH_FETCH_SIZE: How many stories to fetch when generating from scratch.
#
# What needs to be stored in Redis for the timelines:
#
# * Last story update time for all users.
# * Last timeline update time for all active users.
# * Set of followed users, for every user.
#
# How it should works:
#
# 1. Timelines for all active users are cached in Redis.
# 2. Each cached timeline will hold a maximum of CACHE_SIZE stories.
